    <p>Hello everyone! Just as the title states, my name is Joshua Propst, I just turned 29 years old and decided to make a career change in the coding atmosphere and am very much looking forward to learning from the best of the best at the Grand Circus Bootcamp!</p>
    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>By the time high school graduation came around I still knew deep down that I did not know what I wanted to do in my life careerwise and thus I struggled while attending MCC. Ultimately I decided to forgo the college route until I knew what I wanted to do as I did not want to sink my money and time into a degree that I might not even use. Fast forward 11 years and I know that this is the career that I want to put all of my resources into.</p>
    <p>Being an avid gamer growing up and having friends with similar interests, I had know about coding for a while but never took an interest in it until, roughly seven years ago, one of my best friends attended the Grand Circus Javascript boot camp. At the time I was doing some work in Detroit so I would meet up with him on his lunch breaks and, of course, talked about his experiences while going through the bootcamp. He already had prior coding experience but still he struggled with the adjustment to becoming a full time coder but he kept grinding and eventually graduated and was the first one from his cohort to land a job and he hasn't looked back since. </p>
    <p>To this day, I credit my good friend of being the one to open my eyes to the world of coding and he did it by example. Simply seeing his growth as a person from seven years ago, when he first started, to now is not only a source of inspiration for me but one of the main reasons I was able to have the confidence in myself to make the career change. </p>
    <p>My goal is to become the best coder that I can be and maybe one day I'll be the one inspiring others to join in this rapidly growing field.</p>
